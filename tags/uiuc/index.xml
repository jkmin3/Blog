      <description>As a student who studies everyday and enjoys a variety of different types of study environments, I believe that I have one of the best top 10s list. I have been to over 30 different locations in the Champaign-Urbana area to study and I will be giving you my favorites. In this list, I will be giving you the description and vibe of each study environment. I will also give each of them a how-loud-you-can-be scale from 1-10.</description>
