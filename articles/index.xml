      <description>As a student who has studied numerous hours and enjoys a variety of different types of study environments, I believe I have a good idea on what the best study spots are in the Champaign-Urbana area. Iâ€™ll be diving into my top 10 study spots with short, but descriptive points for each spot.
Main Library  This is my favorite spot to study right now. UIUC Building Interior  Stained window designs Harry Potter hall/oldies vibes Very large space Lots of natural light seep through Lamps have a nice light emanating from them Beautiful   Volume Level  Very nice and quiet You can talk normally but more on the quiet side because the place is so big.</description>
