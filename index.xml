      <description>As a student who studies everyday and enjoys a variety of different types of study environments, I believe that I have one of the best top 10s list. I have been to over 30 different locations in the Champaign-Urbana area to study and I will be giving you my favorites. In this list, I will be giving you the description and vibe of each study environment. I will also give each of them a how-loud-you-can-be scale from 1-10.</description>

      <description>Fetus Health Dataset This dataset contained a variety of features on newborns and it had its classification of 1-Normal, 2-Suspect, 3-Pathological.
Description I used many different models with scikit-learn to predict the outcome of the health of a fetus and ended up using a random forest. I got a result of a 94% accurate model using GridSearchCV to get the best parameters. The only problem is that the grid search take a while, so play around with it.</description>

      <description>Description League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams that consist of five champions fight each other to destroy each other&amp;rsquo;s base while defending their own. There are many ways to get an advantage on your opponent and with all of this data collected on games, I was able to achieve a 73 percent success rate of predicting the game&amp;rsquo;s outcomes correctly using logistic regression.

      <description>Description I used the dataset below to predict the life expectancy of different countries. Using linear regression, I have found out that it is very important for countries to be abundant in income composition of resources and have a good school system. This means that if more people share the wealth, the overall life expectancy should go up in theory.
